## Google Play Store Main Listing Files

* **details.XX.md**

  These files have the Google Play Store listing details. There is one file per
  language. The title of the file is the **"App name"**. The second header is
  the **"Short description"** and main text **"Full description"**.

* **app-icon.svg**, **feature-graphic.svg**, **screenshot-XXX-N.png**

  These are the listing graphics. They are self-explanatory and the file names
  match the fields where they belong in the listing. Some are provided as `svg`
  so they need to be exported as `png` (use the page size when exporting).
