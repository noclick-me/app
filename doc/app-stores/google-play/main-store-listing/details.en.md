noclick.me is a URL expander service that does the opposite of URL shortener services like tinyurl.com or bit.ly, or custom domains like youtu.be for YouTube, goo.gl for Google and w.wiki for WikiMedia. Instead of converting a link to an undecipherable URL, it will produce a long and descriptive URL.

URL shortener services have been very popular for a long time, and they are good to share links that one previously know where they point to. But they can be quite inconvenient when sharing a link without context, and it is sometimes annoying having to click a link, open the browser etc. to know what is it about. Wouldnâ€™t it be great if the link itself would have a description of what is it pointing to?

Enter noclick.me!

noclick.me will retrieve the contents of the link and create an URL with the most relevant information in it, so users can decide if they want to click to find out more or not. Or even when, as one might prefer to open a long interesting article in another moment or device.

For example, https://app.noclick.me/ could be converted to something like https://noclick.me/_https/app.noclick.me/noclick.me_is_a_URL_expander_that_will_transform_any_URL_into_a_self-descriptive_link._including_the_most_important_information_about_the_page_you_are_about_to_visit_.if_you_click_the_link.

WARNING: Please note that this app (and service) are not mature yet, it's a preview release only, so things might not work as expected or it can be a bit rough around the edges. It's all open source and free (https://github.com/noclick-me/), so it is developed in my spare time only. If you'll like to see the development speed up, please consider supporting it so I can work full time on it!
